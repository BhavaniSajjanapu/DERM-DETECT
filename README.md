# Skin Disease Analysis
This project focuses on the development of an automated system for the detection and classification of dermatological disorders using a combination of image processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. Skin disorders are a prevalent global health concern, and early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. By harnessing a diverse dataset of skin images and 
implementing advanced image segmentation and feature extraction methods, the system intends to achieve high accuracy in identifying disorders such as eczema, psoriasis, melanoma, and more. The outcome of this project could significantly contribute to improving the accessibility and speed of dermatological diagnosis, ultimately benefiting patients and healthcare professionals alike.
